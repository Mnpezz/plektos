## Location Features

### Map View

Plektos includes an interactive map powered by Leaflet that displays all events with geographic coordinates. The map automatically:

- Shows event markers with clickable popups containing event details
- Fits bounds to display all visible events
- Displays event status (live events, in-person events)
- Links directly to event detail pages

**To use the map view:**
1. Navigate to the home page
2. Click the "Map" toggle button (alongside Grid and Calendar views)
3. Click on any marker to see event details
4. Click "Click for details →" in the popup to view the full event

### Location-Based Filtering

Find events near you with distance-based sorting:

1. Open the filters panel on the home page
2. Use the "Filter by Location" search
3. Type an address, city, or landmark (e.g., "Times Square, New York" or "Eiffel Tower, Paris")
4. Select a location from the dropdown
5. Events will automatically sort by distance from your selected location
6. Distance badges appear on event cards (e.g., "5.2km away")

### Smart Address Search

When creating or editing events, the location search provides:

- **Global coverage**: Search for any address worldwide
- **Accurate geocoding**: Uses OpenStreetMap's Nominatim API
- **Automatic coordinate storage**: Saves latitude/longitude as geohash (NIP-52 standard)
- **Intelligent debouncing**: Reduces API calls while typing

**Tips for best results:**
- Be specific: Include street numbers, city, and state/country
- Use full addresses when possible
- Try different formats if one doesn't work (e.g., "NYC" vs "New York City")
- Minimum 2 characters required to search

### Geolocation Data Format

Events store location data following the Nostr NIP-52 standard:

- **Geohash** (`g` tag): 9-character encoded coordinates (~4.8m precision)
- **Raw coordinates** (`lat`/`lon` tags): Stored for backward compatibility
- **Human-readable address** (`location` tag): Display text for users
